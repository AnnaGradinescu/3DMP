This is a README file containing information about the final project for the 3D Modeling and Printing optional course. 
The project I chose is a "no fall" toy mechanism. This model's purpose is that it will not fall off the edge of the surface it is on and consists of 12 3D printed parts.

For the second checkpoint, I built the chassis and the front wheels of the toy, for which I attached the following sketches:
1. chassis
2. front wheels

For the third checkpoint of the final project, I finished the sketches for all the components of the toy car, and modeled the following: 
  3. yoke
  4. axle yoke
  5. axle wheel front
  6. axle wheel rotate
  7. axle wheel right rear
  8. wheel right rear
  9. gear motor
  10. wheel left rear

For this checkpoint, I also attached the N20 6VDC 150RPM gear motor to the chassis. The model for the motor was imprted from the Grabcad Community. 
I also tried to find a solution the 3 o-ings on the "wheel left rear", "wheel right rear" and "wheel rotate" components.
