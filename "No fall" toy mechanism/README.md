This is a README file containing information about the final project for the 3D Modeling and Printing optional course. 
The project I chose is a "no fall" toy mechanism. This model's purpose is that it will not fall off the edge of the surface it is on and consists of 12 3D printed parts.

For the first checkpoint, I built the chassis and the front wheels of the toy, for which I attached the following sketches:
